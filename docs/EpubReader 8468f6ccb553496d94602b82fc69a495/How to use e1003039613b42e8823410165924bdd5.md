- **Ebook Viewer** = you can choose between **Custom** and **epubjs**
    - **Custom** is the main viewer, it saves how much time you spent reading and allow you to use on-tap translations. It’s my own custom made viewer.
    - **epubjs** is epub viewer should be used only if **Custom** viewer fails. I did not create **epubjs**. Link to epubjs github repo [https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js)

    - **My Memory** ([https://mymemory.translated.net/](https://mymemory.translated.net/)) = is online translation service, which is free to use but has limitation usage. You translate up to 5000 chars ( not words ).
    - **argos** ([https://github.com/argosopentech](https://github.com/argosopentech)) = is offline translation service. When you try to use argos for the first time, it downloads the language pair pack used for offline translations. You have to wait until download is finished. In case you want to see installed language packages or you want to delete them, go to: `C:\Users\USER\.local\share\argos-translate\packages` on Windows.
        - If you try to use **argos translate for the first time** (on given language pair) it has to install packages. You can see argos translate status in the right upper corner: not ready = red, ready = green
